# MapViewerGL

A modern web-based map viewer that supports multiple data formats and interactive visualization.

üåç [Live Demo](https://bobsa514.github.io/mapviewer-gl/)

## Important Notes

### Data Storage
- **No Data Storage**: Please note that this tool does not store any data on the server. All data processing occurs locally on the user's machine. Once the session is closed, any uploaded data will be lost. This design ensures user privacy and data security.

### Mapbox Token
- **Environment Configuration**: It is crucial to change the `.env` file in your project directory to include your own Mapbox token. This is important because using my token may lead to it being maxed out due to usage limits. 
- To set your token, open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder with your own Mapbox access token:
  ```plaintext
  VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
  ```
